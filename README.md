# Tag Minigame Plugin

Hello Reader,

This is a Java Minigame Plugin that will help boost your Survival Multiplayer, which that being said this plugin is not really meant for an actual minigame server, there is no lobby there is nothing else, besides the core tagging functions. Future updates may come out who knows lol...
So, with that being said commands are simple such as /tag [help/start], it saves the previous tagger in the game but /tag start, chooses a new tagger of online players. I hope to improve this plugin as future development goes on and I figure out where I kinda want to be in my coding career.
This is a really basic plugin but who knows... also /tag knockbackStrength [float] will determine the velocity the player takes knockback at. There is no damage event so don't worry about armor breaking or if someone is on one heart e.t.c, fall damage is still there though to spice things up.

# Future Plans
- Improve Code Readability
- Migrate /tag start to choose a new tagger such as /tag newTagger -- Same Functionality but if you want the old tagger they can still be active (e.x random server shutdown)
- Give a better /tag help and better information on the plugins use.
- Freezetag mode?
- Abilities for the taggers /tag ability <power-up>
- Team Tag where it can be 2v1 like an elimination game mode.
- Permission system?
- Statistics on player info such as how many times they been tagged, tagger, deaths
